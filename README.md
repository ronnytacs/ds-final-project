OCFR website will be the online information system that can manage member, certification, and report information.
The website consists of four different pages: index page, member page, certification page, and report page.

## Page Details
1. Index Page
 Index page displays pictures of OCFR's firefighters as well as contact. Member can contact OCFR if their information is incorrect or external user can ask any question(s).
2. Member Page
 Member page shows the list of members and the details of each member. You can click any of the row or click 'view' button to see the details. You can manage the member by adding or deleting the member with each button. When adding and editing you can see the form validation, preventing you from making mistakes. 
3. Certification Page
 Certification page works in the same way as member page for ease-of-use.
4. Report Page
 On report page, you can download the report based on station number, radio number, and expired certification. If you click one of the tabs, it will show the list and you can filter it out using the dropdown list. Also, you can download the file using 'Download as CSV' button.

Demo of using the website is attached as a video, which fully encompasses the details of your website. Thank you for working with us and feel free to contact our team if you have any questions.
